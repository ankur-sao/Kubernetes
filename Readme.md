Notes of Kubernetes container orchestration system
from udemy course.

Expectation is to learn high level basics of kubernetes.
Learn basic commands. and common use cases where kubernetes
is effective solution relative to docker swarm.

Expand the 80/20 knowledge.
Docker swarm implements 20% of the features provided by kubernetes
and covers 80% of the use cases.

What is the 80% use case? 
What is the rest 20% of the use case? 

Which companies use kubernetes and what is their justification?
Which companies use docker swarm and what is their justification?

What are major challenges in container orchestration?
How do docker swarm / apache mesos / amazon ecs / kubernetes help us with
these challenges? 

What is Kubernetes? 
Kubernetes is container orchestration / portable cloud platform which is becoming
de facto standard for running mircoservice  infrastructure in cloud.
To create a highly available distributed system.

Kubernetes can speed up the development process by 
1. easy and automated deployments,
2. rolling updates
3. managing our apps and services with almost zero downtime. 

Evolution of kubernetes:
1. 2003-2004: BORG : BORG was a large scale cluster management system,
which ran 100Ks of jobs from 1Ks of services in many clusters which included
10Ks of machines.

2. 2013: OMEGA: A flexible, scalable schedular for  large scale cluster.
3. 2014: Kubernets: OMEGA released to the world.
